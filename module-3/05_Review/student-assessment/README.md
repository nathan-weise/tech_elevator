# Module 2 Assessment Exercise

This assessment helps you validate your understanding of the module objectives: 

- SELECT, WHERE, and JOIN statements
- ORDER BY and GROUP BY clauses
- INSERT and UPDATE statements
- DAO methods
- Creating domain objects from SQL data

It also gives you practice with coding assessments you may encounter during the job interview process.

## Overview

This is a time-boxed, individual coding assessment. You have one hour to complete as much of your assigned problem as you can. You are not expected to complete all features of the problem in the time given. 

You may use any resource available except another human being. This is an individual effort.

Whatever you complete should not have compile or run-time errors. Any features you can complete should run successfully.

Any unit tests should also be error-free and run successfully.

If you are nearing the end of the time-box and you have compile/run-time errors, or tests that have compile errors, consider commenting out or removing the code causing the errors before you push your final effort.

At the end of the time-box, you should push your final effort to your class repository.

If you finish before the end of the time-box, please be respectful of those still working. 



## Instructions

2. You should see two folders: a `part-1` and a `part-2`.
4. Begin with `part-1`. Enter that folder in your command line and run `sh import-databases.sh`.
5. Fill out the `solution.sql` file with the correct SQL statements to satisfy the requirements.
6. `part-2` represents a DAO project that you will finish. Complete the `DAO` class and use the unit tests to check the correctness of the methods.
7. Be sure to push your final effort when you are done or at the end of the time-box.
8. Your instructor will tell you when to begin and give you a "10-minute warning" before the end of the time-box.
