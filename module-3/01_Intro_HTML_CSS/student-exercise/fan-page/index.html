    <p> When I’m having a good time in ARK, I’m having a really good time. The problem is that those moments are usually one part to every nine parts menial grinding and crafting - especially at the later tech tiers. Having to repeat so much work after failing an attempt at a boss feels far too punishing, and some really dumb dinosaurs can take a lot of the challenge and sense of danger out of the many primal locations. Even with all of those quirks, however, I’m still hungry to play more after the 60 hours I’ve spent so far. There aren’t a lot of survival games that have legitimately held my attention that long.</p>

        <p>ARK: Survival Evolved is totally worth it for both single-player and multiplayer experiences. People who enjoy survival games will enjoy a game much less stressful than Rust, along with a crazy amount of dinosaurs.

            If you don’t enjoy survival type games, then you won’t like ARK. There are always plenty of options for people who hate certain parts of the game, such as playing unofficial servers for better taming rates or changing the settings for your single-player game.
            
            I recommend buying ARK on sale, and I think you should prepare to be wowed at the insane amount of content packed into it.</p>
